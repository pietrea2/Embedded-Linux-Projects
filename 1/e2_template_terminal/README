*** NOTE: your solution should display the time on BOTH the console AND the HEX display ***

You may choose to write one solution that displays the same information to the HEX display 
and the console at the same time, or you may choose to make two copies of this template,
write two separate solutions (console and HEX) and upload two submission archives to quercus.


To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.
To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: part1.c
part2: timer.c
part3: stopwatch.c


Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1
part2: ./runall.sh 2
part3: ./runall.sh 3


To clean all directories and remove all drivers: ./runall clean


To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.
