To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.


To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: part1.c
part2: part2.c
part3: part3.c
part4: part4.c
part5: part5.c

Note: part 5 requires reading key and switch values.  You may choose to use the built-in 
drivers (located in /home/root/Linux_Libraries/drivers/) or the KEY_SW driver you wrote for 
lab exercise 4 (please include your driver with your submission, and note that you will need 
to modify the runall.sh script to load your driver), or you may choose to use memory mapped IO.


Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1
part2: ./runall.sh 2
part3: ./runall.sh 3
part4: ./runall.sh 4
part5: ./runall.sh 5


To clean all directories and remove all drivers: ./runall clean


To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.


If you would like to clarify your interpretation of the exercise instructions 
or provide any additional information to the grader, please add it to the README.

Note: you must add at least one additional feature to part 5.
      Please describe your feature in the README.
