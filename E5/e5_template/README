To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.


To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: part1.c
part2: part2.c
part3: part3.c
part4: part4.c
part5: part5.c

Note: part 5 requires reading key and switch values.  You may choose to use the built-in 
drivers (located in /home/root/Linux_Libraries/drivers/) or the KEY_SW driver you wrote for 
lab exercise 4 (please include your driver with your submission, and note that you will need 
to modify the runall.sh script to load your driver), or you may choose to use memory mapped IO.


Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1
part2: ./runall.sh 2
part3: ./runall.sh 3
part4: ./runall.sh 4
part5: ./runall.sh 5


To clean all directories and remove all drivers: ./runall clean


To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.

Please describe the additional features you added to part 5 here:

For part5 we added 3 additional animation features (2 that are activated with SW_8 and SW_9).

Feature #1 is that the vertices and lines flicker random colours as the program runs.
This feature is active by default.
If any switch between SW_0 - SW_7 is turned on, the
lines between the vertices are not drawn.

Feature #2 is that all vertices and lines are SAME global colour if SW_8 is ON.
Also, if any switch between SW_0 - SW_7 is turned on when in this mode (SW_8 is ON), then the
lines between the vertices are not drawn.

Feature #3 is that vertices and lines stay their own constant colour if SW_9 is ON.
This is stops the flickering of random colours (our default feature).
Similarly, if any switch between SW_0 - SW_7 is turned on when in this mode, then the
lines between the vertices are not drawn.
