To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.

To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: part1.c
part2: signal_generator.c
part3: part3.c
part4: part4.c

NOTE: the template is set up for using the built-in KEY and SW drivers for the
user code in parts 3 and 4.  You may use memory mapped IO if you prefer.

Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1
part2: ./runall.sh 2
part3: ./runall.sh 3
part4: ./runall.sh 4

To clean all directories and remove all drivers: ./runall clean


To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.
