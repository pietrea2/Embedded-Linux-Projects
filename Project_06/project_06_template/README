To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.


To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: part1.c, video.c
part2: part2.c, video.c
part3: part3.c, video.c
part4: part4.c, video.c
part5: part5.c, video.c
part6: part6.c, video.c


Note: parts 5 and 6 require reading key and switch values.  You may choose to use the built-in 
drivers (located in /home/root/Linux_Libraries/drivers/) or the KEY_SW driver you wrote for 
lab exercise 4 (please include your driver with your submission, and note that you will need 
to modify the runall.sh script to load your driver).


Note: you will need to either connect your De1SoC to a VGA monitor or run the provided
VGA emulator prior to running the runall.sh script.

To use the vga emulator:
Connect to your De1SoC using a VNC viewer.
Type 'make' in the vga_emulator directory.
Run the emulator using './vga'
Run the runall.sh script in a separate terminal.


Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1
part2: ./runall.sh 2
part3: ./runall.sh 3
part4: ./runall.sh 4
part5: ./runall.sh 5
part6: ./runall.sh 6


To clean all directories and remove all drivers: ./runall clean


To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.
