Part 3:
rate R command supports the following data rate values: 0.10, 0.20, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 Hz.
The user can insert the numbers for R:                    10,   20,   39,   78,  156,  125, 25, 50, 100, 200
This is because the kenrel has problems scanning floating point inputs unfortunately.

Part 4:
When user taps the board, the bubble toggles between * and O.
When the user double taps, the bubble changes to a random colour.
