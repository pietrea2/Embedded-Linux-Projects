To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.

To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: part1.c
part2: part2.c
part3: part3.c
part4: part4.c
part5: part5.c
part6: part6.c


Note: parts 4-6 require video output; you may use the built-in video driver (located in
/home/root/Linux_Libraries/drivers) and call the wrapper functions described in the header file
video.h (in /usr/include/intepfpgaup/).

Note: parts 5 and 6 require reading KEY values and LEDR output.  You may use the built-in
KEY and LEDR drivers (located in /home/root/Linux_Libraries/drivers/) and call the 
wrapper functions in KEY.h and LEDR.h (in /usr/include/intelfpgaup/).

Note: parts 5 and 6 require a stopwatch driver.  You may use the provided stopwatch.ko and 
call the API fuctions in include/stopwatch.h and stopwatch_wrappers.c.


Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1
part2: ./runall.sh 2 XXXXXXXXXXXXX     (13-bit vector indicating which notes to play)
part3: ./runall.sh 3 <keyboard path>
part4: ./runall.sh 4 <keyboard path>
part5: ./runall.sh 5 <keyboard path>
part6: ./runall.sh 6 <keyboard path>

Note: you may wish to hard-code your keyboard path into the script while testing


To clean all directories and remove all drivers: ./runall clean


To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.
