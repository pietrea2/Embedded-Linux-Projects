To facilitate accurate marking, your submitted solution must use this template.

To complete each part of the exercise, add your own code to the following files:
part1: edgedetect.c
part2: edgedetect.c
part3: edgedetect.c

NOTE: part 2 includes optional video output and is set up to use the built-in video driver.


Please test your solution using the provided runall.sh script:
part1: ./runall.sh 1   <input image file name (no path)> [-d] [-v]
                       optional -d produces debug output for each stage
                       optional -v draws the input and output images on a video-out display
part 2: ./runall.sh 2  <input image file name (no path)>"
part 3: ./runall.sh 3  <input image file name (no path)>"


**IMPORTANT NOTES**
1.  Before reconfiguring the FPGA (loading an .rbf file), you must remove all drivers (using lsmod and rmmod)
2.  Parts 2 and 3 will not work with the vga emulator. You must use a vga monitor to display output images.
3.  Part 1 will work with the vga emulator, but reconfiguring the FPGA (loading a different rbf file)
    while the emulator is running will crash the emulator.  
    When using the emulator, please remove all drivers and then manually configure the FPGA by typing:
    /home/root/misc/program_fpga ./DE1_SoC_Computer.rbf


To clean all directories, remove all drivers, and reload the default FPGA image: ./runall clean

To submit your solution: ./runall.sh submit 
The script generates a .tar.bz2 archive. Please upload this
archive to quercus (only one team member needs to do this).


The script may generate errors, for example:
ERROR: Removing 'timer': No such file or directory
These errors can be ignored.
